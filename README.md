=================================================

## Login Script

#### Group: Andrew Galvin, Amilcar Spezia, Alex White, Steven Wilkins

### Why switch to our code
Our login code offers a secure way to manage your users logins. With this secure code, you can have peace of mind. Our code is compliant with PEP8 standards, uses efficient loggin methods, validates user entries, and implements an effcient Try/Except statement to keep everthing running smoothly.

### Modules
```
main/
├── login.py
├── loginInfo.text
└── 10K-common-passwords.txt
```
#### `login.py`
This is the main file that contains the login script

#### `loginInfo.txt`
This file contains all the usernames and salted/hashed passwords

#### `10k-common-passwords.txt`
This file contains the 10K most common paswwords to compare against

* log to sys
* log to file
